# AI Oracle

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to build with on-chain AI.

ORA offers:

* zkML of [keras2circom](https://github.com/ora-io/keras2circom) (the most battle-tested and performant zkML framework)
* [opML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555) of [AI Oracle](./) (run huge model like LlaMA2-7B and Stable Diffusion now)
* zk+opML with [opp/ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006) (futuristic on-chain AI fuses zkML's privacy and opML's scalability)
{% endhint %}

[AI Oracle (OAO)](https://blockworks.co/news/ora-on-chain-oracle-ethereum) is the ORA's verifiable and decentralized AI oracle.

The CLE in AI Oracle, along with the AI models contained within the Oracle, define the computations and model specifications for OAO/opML nodes.

Smart contract developers can create their own contracts based on various CLEs in the AI Oracle to interact with the OAO contract, enabling the use of AI on-chain.
