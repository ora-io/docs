### Methods for Development

For the development of a CLE, we offer two development methods:

1. [CLE Studio on Web UI](1.-zkgraph-studio-ui.md) (🐣 INTRODUCTORY): Easy-to-use integrated web code editor and interface for experiencing zkGraph development for the first time.
2. [CLE Scaffold](2.-zkgraph-scaffold.md) (✨ RECOMMENDED): More customizable and end-to-end scaffold for CLE development.

### Examples

Example CLEs can be found as [templates of CLE scaffold](https://github.com/ora-io/cle-cli/tree/main/packages/create-zkgraph/templates).
