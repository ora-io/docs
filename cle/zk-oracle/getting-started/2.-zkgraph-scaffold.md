# 2. CLE Scaffold

[CLE Scaffold](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cle) contains all the SDK and some common AssemblyScript data structures needed for CLE development.

The scaffold will provide you information on the usage inside its README.

<table><thead><tr><th width="177">Package</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cle">create-cle</a></td><td>Scaffold for setting up CLE with preset templates</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ora-io/cle-cli">cle-cli</a></td><td>CLI for developing CLE locally (compile, execute, prove...)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ora-io/cle-lib">cle-lib</a></td><td>Library for CLE compilation and other helper data structures</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ora-io/cle-api">cle-api</a></td><td>Library for CLI's interactions with zkOracle node</td></tr></tbody></table>

Previously, we offered CLE scaffold as [a template repo](https://github.com/ora-io/zkgraph/tree/b9fe1a6c2efd7e6a5793c47799da8745c1c748c4). That is now archived, and we recommend using CLE Scaffold (create-cle) instead.
