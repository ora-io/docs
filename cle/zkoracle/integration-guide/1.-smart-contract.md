# 1. Smart Contract

Integrating with a smart contract involves using the computation result on-chain within a smart contract. For example, you might want to access historical event data directly inside your smart contract in a trustless manner.

When integrating with a smart contract, you can use:

* [**zkAutomation**](../../cle-standards/zkoracle/zkautomation/): A standard adopted by all zkOracle nodes. It will help you submit computation results and proofs, which are verified on-chain by a universal verifier smart contract. Requirements can be found under zkAutomation user guide.
* **Prove Per Request (WIP):** This feature will fulfill your on-chain compute and prove requests by asynchronously submitting the results and proofs.
