# 2. Frontend / Backend

Integrating with the frontend or backend involves using the computation result off-chain. For example, you might want to access historical event data in the frontend without relying on centralized and trusted archive node services.

When integrating with the frontend or backend, you can use:

* **CLE-API Library:** This TypeScript API library contains essential calls for interacting with zkOracle. After deploying your CLE with Web IDE or Scaffold, you can use the API library in your project to call operations such as executing the CLE, generating proofs of CLE computation, and verifying proofs. These operations are entirely off-chain and do not require on-chain operations.
* **zkIndexing (WIP)**

Example integration: [ZKLife](https://github.com/YolaYing/ZKLife/tree/main/backend).
