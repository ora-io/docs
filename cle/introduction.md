# Introduction

CLE, or computational entity, refers to customizable and programmable software defined by developers, and the underlying oracle network that runs this software. ORA CLE makes Oracle complete.

Currently, there are two types of CLE:

* **CLE of AI Oracle**: **The AI/ML models integrated in** [**OAO**](ai-oracle/) **are the core of CLE of AI Oracle**. Currently, CLE of AI Oracle includes Stable Diffusion and LlaMA2-7B, with distributed nodes of AI Oracle network.
* **CLE of zkOracle**: **The zk-powered programs (previously zkGraph) powered by zkOracle nodes**. Currently, CLE of zkOracle is fully decentralized and permissionless, so that anyone can build one.  Now we have [40+ open source CLEs of zkOracle](https://github.com/ora-io/awesome-ora#-zk-oracle-cle-ecosystem), with distributed nodes of zkOracle network.

Both types of CLE have various use cases:

* **CLE of AI Oracle**: AIGC NFT with ERC-7007, zkKYC using facial recognition based on ML, on-chain AI games (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons), prediction market with ML, content authenticity (deepfake verifier), compliant programmable privacy, prompt marketplace, reputation/credit scoring...
* **CLE of zkOracle**: ZK rollup, ZK automation-based applications, ZK historical data, ZK bridge, ZK coprocessor, zkML applications...
