# Example: OAO Farcaster Frame

To illustrate how Onchain AI Oracle can be used in consumer facing products, we introduce [FortuneTeller](https://github.com/hadzija7/fortune-teller-frame).

### About FortuneTeller

FortuneTeller utilizes NestedInference smart contract discussed in [Advanced Usages of OAO](advanced-usages-of-oao.md). The goal of the application is to onboard new users to Web3 and demonstrate how Onchain AI Oracle could be used.

Application flow is as follows:

1. Application first prompts users to answer specific questions to the Magic Wizard.&#x20;
2. Wizard then casts its spells and tells fortune, by requesting inference from AI Oracle.&#x20;
3. Under the hood Llama3 model first returns the textual response, which is then forwarded as prompt to StableDiffusion for image generation.&#x20;
4. Users can then mint AI generated NFTs, if they are happy with their fortune image.

The image on the right represents user's fortune result generated by AI Oracle:

* Image generated by Stable Diffusion v3 ([onchain tx](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xb4d1a57d24cceb8270ea96d5f1a817fefe0d6a09b1766b5c1502795529d1f2eb))

### Benefits of using AI Oracle in FortuneTeller

* **AI-Generated Fortune Without Bias:** The AI delivers fortune readings neutrally, ensuring an objective and impartial experience.
* **Immutable On-Chain Fortune:** Your fortune is securely stored on the blockchain, making it unchangeable and tamper-proof.
* **Verifiable Fortune Generation:** With opML, the entire process of generating your fortune is transparent and verifiable, ensuring trust in the system.

### Build your own AI dapps!

ðŸ’¡ In the case you want to build another frame, we provided [oao-frame-template](https://github.com/ora-io/oao-frame-template) repository. This template can help you bootstrap your Farcaster application, but modifications need to be made depending on the use case.&#x20;

We encourage you to build your own applications. Some ideas could be found at [awesome-ora](https://github.com/ora-io/awesome-ora) repository.

It can be Farcaster frame, Telegram mini app, or any other type of client application that interacts with AI Oracle.
