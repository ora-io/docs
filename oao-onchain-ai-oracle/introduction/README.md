# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to build with onchain AI.

ORA offers:

* zkML of [keras2circom](https://github.com/ora-io/keras2circom) (the most battle-tested and performant zkML framework)
* [opML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555) of [AI Oracle](./) (run huge model like LlaMA2-7B and Stable Diffusion now)
* zk+opML with [opp/ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006) (futuristic onchain AI fuses zkML's privacy and opML's scalability)
{% endhint %}

[Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)](https://blockworks.co/news/ora-on-chain-oracle-ethereum) is the ORA's verifiable and decentralized AI oracle.

OAO integrates different AI models onchain in ORA AI Oracle nodes.

Smart contract developers can build their own contract based on different models in AI Oracle, to interact with OAO contract, so that they can use AI onchain.

Some of the example use cases are: AIGC NFT with ERC-7007, zkKYC using facial recognition based on ML, onchain AI games (e.g. Dungeon and Dragons), prediction market with ML, content authenticity (deepfake verifier), compliant programmable privacy, prompt marketplace, reputation/credit scoring... For example integrations and ideas to build, see [awesome-ora](https://github.com/ora-io/awesome-ora#-ai-oracle-cle-ecosystem).
