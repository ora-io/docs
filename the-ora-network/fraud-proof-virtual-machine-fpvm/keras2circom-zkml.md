# Keras2Circom (zkML)

### Introduction

ZkML is a proving framework that leverages Zero-Knowledge proofs to prove the validity of ML inference result on-chain. Due to its private nature it can protect confidential data and model parameters during training and inference, thus addressing privacy issues and reducing blockchain's computational load.

[Keras2Circom](https://github.com/ora-io/keras2circom), built by ORA, is the first advanced zkML framework that is battle-tested. From [a recent benchmark](https://hackmd.io/\_vrpMIusSEaROYUU7-Shaw) by Ethereum Foundation ESP Grant Proposal \[FY23-1290] on leading zkML frameworks, Keras2Circom and its underlying [circomlib-ml](https://github.com/socathie/circomlib-ml) are proven to be performant than other frameworks.

### Ecosystem

Besides being production-ready, circomlib-ml has rich ecosystem:

* [nova-ml](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/nova-ml) by Ethereum Foundation
* [zator](https://github.com/lyronctk/zator)
* [ZKaggle](https://github.com/z-kaggle/ZKaggle)
