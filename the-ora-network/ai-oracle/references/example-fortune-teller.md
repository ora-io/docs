# Example: Fortune Teller

To showcase how AI Oracle can enhance consumer-facing products, we introduce [Fortune Teller](https://github.com/hadzija7/fortune-teller-frame).

### About Fortune Teller

Fortune Teller leverages the NestedInference smart contract, as discussed in the [Advanced Usages of AI Oracle](../advance-examples.md). This application aims to onboard new users to Web3 and demonstrate the capabilities of [AI Oracle](https://ai.ora.io/).

### Application Flow

1. **User Interaction:** The application prompts users to answer specific questions posed by the Magic Wizard.
2. **Fortune Telling:** The Wizard casts its spells by requesting inferences from **AI Oracle**.
3. **Response Generation:** The Llama3 model generates a textual response, which is then used as a prompt for image creation via StableDiffusion.
4. **NFT Minting:** Users can mint AI-generated NFTs if they are satisfied with their fortune image.

### Benefits of using AI Oracle in Various Applications

* **Objective AI-Generated Insights:** AI provides neutral and unbiased outputs, ensuring a fair experience across diverse use cases.
* **Immutable Onchain Data:** Information generated is securely stored on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and easily verifiable.
* **Transparent Data Generation:** Utilizing opML, the entire generation process is transparent, fostering trust in the system across different applications.
