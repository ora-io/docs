# AI Oracle Overview

## Introduction

AI Oracle is a pull-based oracle. This means users will get one response (an AI inference result) from one request (one prompt) on-demand. Our new batch mint feature enables one request to return multiple AI inference results in one response.

### Workflow

1. **Initiate Request**: The user contract sends an inference request to AI Oracle by calling the `requestCallback` function.
2. **opML Request**: AI Oracle creates an opML request based on the user contract request.
3. **Event Emission**: AI Oracle emits a `requestCallback` event collected by the opML node.
4. **ML Inference**: The opML node performs the AI model computation.
5. **Result Submission**: The opML node uploads the result on-chain.
6. **Callback Execution**: The result is dispatched to the user's smart contract via a callback function.

### Challenge Process

1. **Challenge Window**: Begins after the result is submitted on-chain (step 5 above).
2. **Verification**: opML validators or any network participant can check the results and challenge the output if it is incorrect.
3. **Result Update**: If a challenge is successful, the incorrect result is updated on-chain.
4. **Finality**: After the challenge period, the result is finalized onchain and made immutable.

## Simple Smart Contract Integration

To connect your smart contract with AI Oracle:

* Inherit `AIOracleCallbackReceiver` in your contract and bind with a specific AI Oracle address:

```solidity
constructor(IAIOracle _aiOracle) AIOracleCallbackReceiver(_aiOracle) {}
```

* Write your callback function to handle the inference result from AI Oracle. Note that only the AI Oracle can call this function:

```solidity
function aiOracleCallback(uint256 requestId, bytes calldata output, bytes calldata callbackData) external override onlyAIOracleCallback()
```

* When you want to initiate an AI inference request, call AI Oracle as follows:

```solidity
aiOracle.requestCallback(modelId, input, address(this), gas_limit, callbackData);
```

Usage of AI Oracle requires a fee for each request. You can request the current fee by:

1. Call to read `estimateFee` in AI Oracle or your integrated contract with the specific model ID
2. Youâ€™ll receive back the estimated fee in wei
3. Call to write and request the AI inference on your contract, filling in the estimated fee in ether
