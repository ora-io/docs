# Node Operator Guide

ORA's[ AI Oracle](broken-reference) is designed with decentralization at its core. It ensures that AI inference results are verifiable onchain using [opML](../fraud-proof-virtual-machine-fpvm-and-frameworks/opml.md) and censorship-resistant. ORA's network is built on a permissionless node structure, allowing anyone to run the node client software.
