# Node Operator Guide

[Onchain AI Oracle](broken-reference) is designed with decentralization at its core. By leveraging the decentralized network architecture, OAO ensures that AI inference results are not only secure and verifiable onchain powered by ORA's [opML](broken-reference), but also permissionless and censorship-resistant.

Onchain AI Oracle network is built on a permissionless node structure, allowing anyone to run the node client software and contribute, upholding the principles of decentralization and enhancing the overall security and reliability of AI inferences on the blockchain.

You can find guides to run the node in next sections.
