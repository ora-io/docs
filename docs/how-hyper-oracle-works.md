# How Hyper Oracle Works

Hyper Oracle powers developers to build end-to-end trustless and decentralized application with indexing and automation infrastructure.

Hyper Oracle is a decentralized protocol and network:

* Used by Developers: Developers can define custom computations with JavaScript, register those computations to Hyper Oracle protocol, and utilize Hyper Oracle zkGraph standard to automate or supercharge their smart contracts.
* Operated by zkOracle Nodes: Node operators can run zkOracle node to execute and generate zk proofs for developer-defined computations.

### "Programmable" + "zkOracle Protocol"

"Programmable" means Hyper Oracle's indexing and automation zkGraph Standards (Meta Apps) are fully customizable and flexible. Any computation can be defined and all computations will be secured by a generated zk proof.

"zkOracle Protocol" means Hyper Oracle network nodes are zkOracles. zk technology provides computation integrity, verifiablity, and security for general computation. zkOracle is an oracle that utilizes zk for computation to secure the oracle in a trustless manner. As long as the whole network has 1 honest zkOracle, the network will be secure without the need for staking mechanism.

### Benefits for Developers

* All-in-one Infrastructure with Automation and Indexing
* Verifiable, Decentralized, and Secure Network
* Programmable and Flexible Infrastructure
* Faster Performance and Shorter Finality

### Advantages as Network

* A unstoppable autonomous protocol and network
* Math as the consensus
* Safeguarding the security of the base layer
* A 1-of-N trust model
* Optimal cryptography-native decentralization
* Efficient computing power allocation (ideally no excess wasted)
