# How HyperOracle Works

HyperOracle provides infrastructure, including automation and indexing, that empowers developers to build end-to-end trustless and decentralized applications.

HyperOracle is a decentralized protocol and network:

* **Used by Developers**: Developers can define custom computations with JavaScript, register those computations to HyperOracle protocol, and utilize HyperOracle zkGraph standard to automate or supercharge their smart contracts.
* **Operated by zkOracle Nodes**: Node operators can run zkOracle nodes to execute and generate zero-knowledge proofs for developer-defined computations.

### Benefits for Developers

* All-in-one infrastructure with automation and indexing
* Higher performance and shorter finality
* Run arbitrary program

### Advantages as Network

* An unstoppable autonomous protocol and network
* Optimal cryptography-native decentralization
* Verifiable, decentralized, and secure network
* Safeguarding the security of the base layer
* Efficient allocation of computing power
* Math as the consensus
* A 1-of-N trust model
