[World Supercomputer](https://worldsupercomputer.io/) is a set of topologically heterogenous peer-to-peer networks connected by secure data bus. This is a new concept of global network, first introduced by HyperOracle.

While Ethereum consensus maintains its global ledger, the specialized networks scale computing power and storage capacity. For example, HyperOracle is meant to handle the computation part.

HyperOracle is committed to supporting Ethereum as the World Computer and its ecosystem for the future of DeFi, zkML, AI x Crypto, etc.
