# 1. zkGraph Studio UI

### Intro to zkGraph Studio

[Hyper Oracle zkGraph Studio](https://www.hyperoracle.io/app/zkGraphStudio) offers an easy-to-use web code editor and interface for develop zkGraph directly on Web UI.

Developers will be able to develop, validate, configure, and publish a zkGraph to Hyper Oracle testnet by using zkGraph Studio.

Check out the [video walkthrough ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_4W615T1gdY)of zkGraph Studio UI!

### 1. Deposit Testnet ETH Balance

In order to develop,  validate, and publish zkGraph, you need to deposit Testnet ETH first.

Click the `Connect` button in the upper right corner of the MVP page, select `MetaMask`, and confirm the connection in the wallet.

After a successful connection, you will see the `Connect` button change to your address, e.g. `0x420...6969`.

Click the `0x420...6969` button in the upper right corner again. At this point, the deposit session box will pop up.

In the text box under `ETH Amount`, enter the amount you want to deposit, 0.02 is recommended (at least 0.004). Click `Confirm` and confirm the transaction in the wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
If balance is not updated with confirmation of transaction, click "use a transaction hash" to post it.
{% endhint %}

You can click on the `0x420...6969` button again to see if the `ETH Balance` has changed.

### 2. Start to create new zkGraph

After connecting your wallet and toping up Testnet ETH, click `Create a new zkGraph`  to go to zkGraph Studio.

### 3. Develop zkGraph

A [zkGraph](broken-reference) has 2 major parts: `mapping.ts` (data mapping for off-chain computation), and `zkgraph.yaml` (configuration for this zkGraph).&#x20;

In the zkGraph Studio page, we can see the Code Editor at the top. There are two sections `mapping.ts` and `lib` under `project`.

Below the code editor, the input boxes represent a simplified form of `zkgraph.yaml`.

The following is a more specific description of the two code files:

* `mapping.ts` is the core logic of zkGraph, defining the off-chain computational logic that will be used to run and generate proofs in zkWASM. You can modify it as you like.
* `lib` is the wrapping logic which should NOT be modified by default.

For zkGraph development, you can refer to the tutorials and development tips in [zkGraph Template](https://github.com/hyperoracle/zkgraph#zkgraph-template), as well as [zkGraph AssemblyScript Lib doc](../zkgraph-assemblyscript-lib.md).

### 4.  Validate zkGraph

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is to validate that your zkGraph can execute and generate proofs properly.
{% endhint %}

#### a) Compile and Setup

We start by clicking the light blue Start button in the upper right corner of the Code Editor. In the Code Editor file, a `zkgraph.wat` file will appear, which is the wat format of our compiled wasm file, and you can directly view its underlying code and other content.

Scroll down, and you will see `hyper_oracle.wasm` generated under `Generated WASM Binary`, which is the binary format of the wasm file. You can download it by clicking on it.

Go ahead and click the `SET UP` button in the bottom right corner, and after a while, you will see the created ZKWASM Image ID. In this step we deploy the wasm file we just generated to the Hyper Oracle node, for proof generation.

#### b) Generate Output State and Proof

Next, you can see that we will be executing on a specific block `0x10d...` (or other blocks you designate). This step will perform pure execution and generate output state for our zkGraph.

After clicking `EXECUTE` and waiting for a while, we can see that the Output State has been updated, which means that the state of our zkGraph has been updated and the execution was successful.

We have everything ready for zk proof generation for the zkGraph run. Click `GENERATE`, sign it in the wallet, start zk proof generation, and after a while, we can see the proof details finally being generated and confirmed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/截屏2023-07-22 15.17.04.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can view the zk proof directly by clicking on `View Detail`.

After these steps, we can click `Next Step` to continue to configure zkGraph.

### 5. Configure zkGraph

This step defines the basic information used for displaying in the zkGraph explorer, the basic configuration for running this zkGraph, as well as the bounty configuration for incentivizing Hyper Oracle nodes to run the zkGraph.

Just fill in the appropriate information. Note that the `Destination Contract Address`  is the onchain contract that will be triggered by automation of zkGraph.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/截屏2023-07-22 15.26.44.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In addition, you need to set `Bounty`. The Bounty is the amount of reward to Hyper Oracle nodes for zkGraph's computational tasks (including generating proofs and onchain calls).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/截屏2023-07-22 15.29.32.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After these steps, we can click `Next Step` to continue to publish zkGraph.

### 6. Publish zkGraph

In this step, we will publish our zkGraph to Hyper Oracle testnet.

Click `UPLOAD` button to upload zkGraph code and settings to IPFS.

Then, click `DEPLOY` button and confirm the transaction in the wallet to deploy Verification Contract for zk proof of this zkGraph.&#x20;

Finally, deploy and register the zkGraph with onchain registary contract to complete the deployment.

### 7. View your zkGraph

After the deployment is complete, you can go back to [zkGraph Studio page](https://www.hyperoracle.io/app/zkGraphStudio) to see your zkGraphs.

Click on this zkGraph, and you can see the information you just set up.
