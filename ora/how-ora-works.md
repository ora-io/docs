# How ORA Works

ORA provides developers with an easy way to build end-to-end trustless and decentralized applications with:

* **AI Oracle (OAO - Onchain AI Oracle)**
* **zkOracle**

ORA is a decentralized protocol and network:

* **Used by Developers**: Developers can define custom computations, register those computations to ORA protocol, and utilize the ORA CLE standards to supercharge their smart contracts with automation or AI.
* **Operated by AI / ZK Oracle Nodes**: Node operators can run AI / ZK Oracle nodes to execute and secure computations with verifiable proofs.

### Benefits for Developers

* All-in-one infrastructure with AI capability and automation
* Higher performance and shorter finality
* Run arbitrary program and any large ML model

### Advantages of ORA Oracle Network

* Unstoppable autonomous protocol and network
* Optimal cryptography-native decentralization
* Verifiable, decentralized, and secure network
* Safeguarding the security of the base layer
* Efficient allocation of computing power
* 1-of-N trust model
