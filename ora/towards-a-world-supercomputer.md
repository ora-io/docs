# Towards a World Supercomputer

{% hint style="info" %}
For more details, check out World Supercomputer's [litepaper](https://ethresear.ch/t/towards-world-supercomputer/15487).
{% endhint %}

[World Supercomputer](https://worldsupercomputer.io/) is a set of topologically heterogenous peer-to-peer networks connected by a secure data bus. This is a new concept of a global network, first introduced by ORA.

While Ethereum consensus maintains its global ledger, the specialized networks scale computing power and storage capacity. For example, ORA serves the role of scaling computation and AI capabilities of the network.

ORA is committed to supporting Ethereum as the World Computer and its ecosystem for the future of DeFi, zkML, AI x Crypto, etc.

We hold regular World Supercomputer Summits. Check out the recaps:
