# opp/ai

opp/ai, Optimistic Privacy-Preserving AI, integrates Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) for privacy with Optimistic Machine Learning (opML) for efficiency, creating a hybrid model tailored for on-chain AI.

Compared to pure zkML, opp/ai has much better performance with the same privacy feature:

The Future of on-chain AI is opp/ai:

* Past - zkML: Utilize zero-knowledge proof to secure AI models. However, it is still unfeasible and impractical to run complex models.
* Current - opML: Make LlaMA2 and Stable Diffusion models on-chain now through optimistic mechanisms
* Future - opp/ai: The latest solution, combining zkML and opML, enables Ethereum to run any model with privacy features.

opp/ai, as the latest fusion of zkML and opML, can include any zkML approach. It means that advances in zkML will be directly reflected in opp/ai.
