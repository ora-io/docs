description: Enable IMO with Onchain AI Model and Revenue Sharing Token
---

# Technology

IMO requires two core components:

* Onchain AI Model with Verifiability
* Revenue Sharing of Onchain Usage

### a) Onchain AI Model <a href="#heading-a-onchain-ai-model" id="heading-a-onchain-ai-model"></a>

IMO need a way to run AI models fully on chain and verifiably.

We invented [opML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17555.pdf) and [opp/ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006), the only two solutions to make any AI model onchain.

**Currently, opML is at the core of OAO (Onchain AI Oracle), which is essential to bring AI models to IMO**.

### b) Revenue Sharing <a href="#heading-b-revenue-sharing-through-erc-7641-intrinsic-revshare-token" id="heading-b-revenue-sharing-through-erc-7641-intrinsic-revshare-token"></a>

Holders of IMO tokens will receive the benefits of revenue streams including but not limited to:

* **Revenue of model usage (Model Ownership, ERC-7641 Intrinsic RevShare Token)**: Each use of the AI model onchain will incur a fee, which will be distributed to IMO tokens.
* **Revenue of AI-generated content (Inference Asset, eg. ERC-7007 Zero-Knowledge AI-Generated Content Token):** Each use of the AI model generates a specific output and result (e.g. Stable Diffusion for an image NFT and Sora for a video NFT), which may carry a royalty fee and a mint fee that can be distributed to IMO tokens.

**We standardized** [**ERC-7641 Intrinsic RevShare Token**](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7641-intrinsic-revshare-token/18999) **to achieve revenue sharing of IMO model token.**
