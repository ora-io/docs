# Key Milestones

The ORA team has been tirelessly publishing research and shipping developer tools, read about our key milestones here:

* **Developed** [**Keras2Circom**](https://github.com/ora-io/keras2circom)**:** The pioneering zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework, outperforming other leading zkML frameworks according to [benchmarks](https://hackmd.io/\_vrpMIusSEaROYUU7-Shaw) by the Ethereum Foundation.
* **Introduced opML:** A novel fraud-proof mechanism enabling the verification of large AI models directly on-chain. [Read the research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555).
* **Invented opp/ai:** The first combined opML and zkML framework, offering both the scalability of opML and the guarantees of zkML. [Read the research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15006).
* **Pioneered Verified Inference for Stable Diffusion:** Achieved verified inference for **Stable Diffusion** on-chain, paving the way for bringing verifiable AI-generated content into the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Integrated the First Large Language Model (LLM) Onchain:** Successfully brought **LlaMA2-7B** outputs on-chain, making advanced AI models accessible within blockchain applications.
* **Launched the First AI Model Tokenization:** Introduced tokenizing AI models to fund open-source development, launching the first tokenized model $OLM based on **OpenLM** through **Initial Model Offerings (IMOs)**.
