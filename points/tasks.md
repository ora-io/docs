# Tasks

#### Task 1: Use ORA Onchain AI Oracle <a href="#heading-task-2-use-ora-onchain-ai-oracle" id="heading-task-2-use-ora-onchain-ai-oracle"></a>

> 3 - 6 Points Per Usage, Repeatable Task

ORA OAO enables verifiable, decentralized AI inference onchain. You can call AI directly onchain through OAO.

To complete:

1. Go to the [ORA OAO Page](https://www.ora.io/app/opml/models)
2. Select a model to use
3. Use OAO on mainnets (eg. Ethereum mainnet, Optimism mainnet…). Follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fcJbeKN1uM) if you have questions.
4. Sign transaction for calling AI request

Once AI results are returned on the same page, you can access and see your score in the [ORA Points Dashboard](https://www.ora.io/app/tasks/dashboard).

You will earn more points if you are using a model tokenized with IMO (right now, there's one available, OLM)
